                                    visualization. Students learn how to extract useful information from large databases
                                    and how
                                    to use this information to support decision-making.</p>

                                    understanding of
                                    the principles, design, and implementation of database systems. This knowledge is
                                    crucial
                                    for computer scientists, as it helps them develop efficient and scalable software
                                    systems
                                    that can store, retrieve, and manipulate large amounts of data.</p>
