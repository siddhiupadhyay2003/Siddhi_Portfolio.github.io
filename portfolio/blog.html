                    <h3>BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY</h3>
                    <p>Blockchain is a buzzword that has been circulating around the tech
                        world for a few years now. But what exactly is it, and how
                        does it work? In this blog, we'll explain blockchain in a way

                    <h3>AI and MACHINE LEARNING</h3>
                    <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) are two of the most rapidly growing
                        fields in technology today. AI refers to the development of computer systems that can perform
                        tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition,
                        decision-making, and language translation. ML, on the other hand, is a subset of AI that
                        involves
                        training computer algorithms to learn from data and make predictions or decisions.
                        Here is a blog that will help you understand the basics of AI and ML:</p>

                    <h3>REACT</h3>
                    <p>React is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It was developed by Facebook
                        and is now widely used by developers around the world. React has become a go-to tool for
                        building dynamic,
                        interactive web applications. Here's a blog to help you understand the basics of React:</p>
